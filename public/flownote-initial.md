# Welcome to FlowNote

FlowNote is a node-based document authoring system that lets you organize your ideas visually on an infinite canvas. Create connected notes, build hierarchies, and write structured documents with ease. Double-click any node to open the **Document Editor** sidebar and start writing!

## Chapter 1: Document Editor

When you double-click a node, the sidebar opens with a **word processor experience**. You'll see the selected node and all its children as a continuous, editable document.

**Rich text formatting:**
- Bold, italic, and underline
- Headings (H1, H2)
- Bullet and numbered lists
- Links

**Tips:**
- Click **+ Append Section** at the bottom to add new child nodes
- Click the **download icon** to export as Markdown
- Each section's title becomes the node title on the canvas

## Chapter 2: Canvas & Navigation

The infinite canvas is your workspace for organizing ideas visually.

**Navigation:**
- **Pan**: Click and drag on empty canvas space
- **Zoom**: Use scroll wheel or pinch gesture
- **Zoom controls**: Use the buttons in the bottom-left corner

**Right-click on empty canvas** to access:
- **New Note**: Add a node at cursor position
- **Auto Layout**: Automatically arrange all nodes in a tree structure

**AI Generation**: Click the **sparkle icon** (top left) to generate content with AI. Describe your topic and FlowNote creates a structured document with connected nodes automatically!
